# VuePress Github Pages

Use [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) to built a static website and deploy on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## Install

```console
npm install
```

or

```console
yarn
```

## Develop

```console
npm run start
```

or

```console
yarn start
```

## Build

```console
npm run start
```

```

## Details

The `README.md` file in the root serves the purpose of `index.html` file.

If you wish to create new pages, you can do so by adding new `.md` files in the root.

If you wish to use a more complicated files/folders structure, make sure that you read and follow the [VuePress usage reference](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/).

VuePress builds your static website in the `/docs` folder which is set to be used by Github Pages in the repository settings.
